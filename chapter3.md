\section{What is Art Music?}

\newthought{To make a case} for the performance of more transcriptions we need to explain the difference between music from previous eras and educational music from the past fifty years that most bands perform.

David Whitwell, in the first volume of his \textit{Aesthetics of Music,} states that music can be naturally categorised into four classes: Art music, Educational music, Functional music and Entertainment music. Art music, the highest ideal he continues, must conform to four conditions, all of which must be present: \begin{enumerate} \item Art music is inspired. \item Art music has no purpose other than the communication of its own aesthetic content. \item Art music is that which enjoys a performance faithful to the intent of the composer. \item Art music must have a listener capable of contemplation.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{Aesthetics of music,} vol. 1, 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Publishing, Austin, 2011, p.~52--53. } \end{enumerate}

\begin{quotation} If any of these conditions are missing, the performance must result in a lesser aesthetic experience. For example, the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven played in a stadium, during the half-time of a professional football game, would fail for the lack of the presence of Condition Number Four. The same Symphony heard in a concert hall, but in a poor performance, not faithful to the intent of the composer, would fail for the lack of the presence of Condition Number Three.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{Aesthetics of music,} vol. 1, 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Publishing, Austin, 2011, p. 53.} \end{quotation}

Functional music includes music for religion, military music, music for weddings, etc. Entertainment music has it's own purpose to entertain. Students have no problem exposing themselves to entertainment music. They need our help to experience Art music. Pierre Boulez stated, \`\`I believe in music that is demanding, that goes into the depth of the human being, not music for entertainment.''\footnote{P Boulez in Battisti, p. 239.}

Whitwell goes on to say that Educational music may have some of the same qualities as Art music, except that it would fail condition number 2; i.e. `Educational music \ldots\ has the specific and \textit{additional} aim to educate.''\footnote{Ibid.} If the composer is preoccupied with writing music that conforms to a myriad of technical restricions; i.e. range of instruments, key signatures, time signatures, rhythms, etc., it is unlikely the composer will produce a work that is an honest representation of their feelings. This is proven by the fact that many of the works that we do consider`standard repertoire'' for the band are at level 4 or above, where the technical restrictions no longer exist.

It is Art music that is the highest ideal and the music that should be used in education. When choosing music for our students to play, it is Art music first and foremost that we should be drawing on: music that was composed with the only intent of communicating the composer's feelings.

What about religious music? Things like the Mozart Requiem or the Bach ??? Mass are now considered Art music \(unless played during a service in which case they are a very high level of religious and functional music\).

What about marches? They were originally examples of functional music, now bordering on entertainment music.

David Whitwell on what is good music: \begin{quotation} Because in English all music is included under one word, \`Music,' some musicians make the mistaken conclusion that all music is therefore somehow equal. A wide variety of music is available to us which uses the same notational language, but to say this makes all music equal in significance is just as absurd as saying Shakespeare and comic books are equal in significance because they both use letters of the alphabet or words of the same language. The reason great literature and great musical literature are more significant than less significant works has to do not with the language \(although, of course, Shakespeare and Mozart \textit{did} use beautiful language\), but with the importance of what it is that that language communicates.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, p. 259.} \end{quotation}

Bruno Walter was more blunt: \begin{quotation} The character of music, as that of every other art, can be superlatively ennobled by chosen individuals, or debased beyond recognition by the inept, inferior or perverse.\footnote{B Walter, \textit{Of music and music-making,} Norton, New York, 1957, p. 18.} \end{quotation}

What is good music? \begin{quotation} The most important characteristic of good music is that it is \textit{inspired} music, music written without purpose other than the composer's honest desire to communicate his feelings. This might be contrasted with what we call \textit{constructed} music, such as the music being turned out in great abundance by educational publishers today. This music is designed for a certain portion of the educational market, designed for mass sales, and is carefully written to meet the technical needs of that market. But it is certainly not inspired music.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, p. 261.} \end{quotation}

An anecdote by David Whitwell will help to explain the difference: \begin{quotation} The deep significance of the distinction between `inspired' and`constructed' music first became clear to me years ago on an occasion when I was invited to rehearse four high school bands in music they were working on. I requested copies of the scores in advance in order to study them and received eight or so of these `constructed' band pieces. As I studied them I wondered how I would ever fill an hour and a half of each band rehearsal with the joy of music using these particular scores. At the concert each band played two works with its own conductor, followed by an honor band consisting of members of each band, with whom I conducted only a short original band composition by Wagner, the \textit{Huldigungsmarsch.} During the concert the audience of parents greeted each of these eight constructed, educational pieces with polite parental applause. After our performance of the Wagner the audience erupted with applause so enthusiastic, and so different in nature, that I was startled, and at a loss to understand why this feeble performance by the under-rehearsed`honor band' had communicated son powerfully. It occurred to me that it was simply an expression of ordinary listeners upon finally hearing an inspired composition.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, p. 262.} \end{quotation}

\section{Can we still tell good music from bad?}

How do we tell good music from bad if we are not taught the skill at our universities?

\begin{quote} We \[composers\] often hear admonitions to raise the level of band music. This can't be done. We can only add to the total sum. What these advocates should be saying is that we must raise the taste of the conductor.---Francis McBeth\footnote{F McBeth in FL Battisti, The winds of change, p. 239.} \end{quote}

Frank Battisti, in an essay titled ``A `Taste' for Quality'', makes an excellent argument that the development of a conductor's repertoire choices is a product of their education as an artist. \begin{quotation} One's continuous contact and study of great art---the grand constructs of \textsc{mankind}---created by musicians (composers, performers, conductors, historians, writers, critics, etc.), authors, poets, painters, sculptors, dancers, historians, philosophers, photographers (as many great creative people as possible!)---is very important for the development of``taste.'' \end{quotation}

```text
He continues,

\begin{quotation}
For those who work or intend to work with wind bands \ldots\ this means making intimate contact with music by composers such as Mozart, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Bach, Bartók, Ives, Ellington, Gershwin, Hindemith.\footnote{Battisti, p. 240}
```

\end{quotation}

Composer John Harbison's advice to composers is equally valid for conductors to develop their skills in appreciating good music from bad.

\begin{quotation} Although all composers should be able to sight read a Bach fugue, conduct Varèse's \textit{Octandre,} write down complex chords in dictation, it might be even more determining that they read \textit{War and Peace,} the Bible, all of Shakespeare, and today's best poetry. The history of music simply doesn't contain any major figures who lacked this intellectual curiosity.\footnote{J Harbison in Battisti, p. 241.} \end{quotation}

To blame composers for trying to make a living, or publishers from trying to make a profit, is misguided. It is up to the conductor to have the intelligence and the courage to only buy music that can make a lasting contribution to the emotional makeup of the students.

At least two or three generations of music teachers have now been raised solely on modern educational band music. What effect has this had? A lowering of knowledge of performance styles and practices? Almost certainly. We have lost almost a century of band performance practice from the 1800s. Considering the popularity of bands through this time it is remarkable how little we know about bands and how they played. What impact has this emphasis on theory and emotionally spartan music had on the last two or three generations of band musicians? Obviously we will never be able to quantify it, and any evidence we do collate would be anecdotal at best. It will come down to personal belief and philosophy.

\section{Programming}

What does all this have to do with programming transcriptions. We have said that the literature guides that many of us have used are weighted heavily in favour of the higher grades and to contemporary music. And we may be just starting out on our conducting journey and don't yet trust our own good taste to pick music that is worthwhile. Luckily the situation is not that complex. Hundreds of years of audiences, composers, critics, and conductors have established for us, by weight of near unanimous consent, a standard repertoire of orchestral, chamber, piano and choral works that we refer to as \`\`the classics.'' Here is a wealth of Art music that would satisfy the harshest of critics.

\begin{quotation} One would hope that everyone would agree that only the best music should be used in music education, that our children be given the best we have.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, p. 273.} \end{quotation}

Not all music must, or deserves, to be played: \begin{quotation} Many composers feel that just because they have written an orchestral composition, society owes them a performance. But no clarinet player feels the world owes him a performance with an orchestra just because he has learned a new concerto. The fact is only music worth playing deserves to be played. It does not matter whether it is new or old. In most cases, for better or worse, the conductor makes this decision.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, pp. 272--273.} \end{quotation}

Battisti sums up the predicament of repertoire selection simply with this statement: \begin{quotation} When called upon to select repertoire, I select music that is appropriate for the players \(and listeners\) and meets the highest artistic standards \(my personal \`\`musical taste''\) developed through a lifetime of contact with great art and artists. For performance, I select repertoire that is \(1\) of the highest musical quality and \(2\) appropriate for the occasion and environment.\footnote{Battisti, p. 242.} \end{quotation}

David Whitwell also distills many of these problems into a simple idea: \begin{quotation} If a conductor, in planning repertoire, makes a list of the works he is desperately wanting to play next, any choice from this list guarantees that he will walk into the rehearsal hall filled with enthusiasm. Further, whatever there is in the music which creates his enthusiasm will also have, to some degree, the same effect on the players. This alone, is a very big step towards an effective rehearsal process.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, p. 276.} \end{quotation}

With one caveat: \begin{quotation} While the conductor has the right to choose his repertoire, he must understand that his choices will reflect on his own character.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, p. 276.} \end{quotation}

\section{Coda}

\begin{quotation} We are not merely giving concerts, we are also crusaders who have the obligation to pass on the great gift of understanding which we have been given to those whom, for whatever reason, have not had the opportunity we have had to be exposed to great music.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, p. 272.} \end{quotation}
