From 1929 to 1934 he was Director of Instrumental Music in the schools of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, conducting the high school bands and orchestras, with first divisions in concert and marching at national band contests.

Succeeding Albert Austin Harding as Director of Bands at Illinois in 1948, he was active in that position and as Professor of Music until his retirement in 1970.

A past president of both the College Band Directors National Association \(1947\) and the American Bandmasters Association \(1957-58\), Dr. Mark Hindsley has appeared throughout the nation and in other countries as guest conductor, clinician and adjudicator, and on the summer staffs of many other colleges and universities.

\null\newpage \section{Lucien Cailliet}

REWRITE - COPIED FROM WIKIPEDIA

Lucien Cailliet \(May 22, 1891 – January 3, 1985\)\[1\] was a French-American composer, conductor, arranger and clarinetist.

Born at Dijon, in France, Cailliet studied at the Conservatory in his native city before migrating to the United States in 1918.

Cailliet worked as staff arranger for the Philadelphia Orchestra. During this time, he founded the Cherry Hill Wind Symphony, which would later become the Wind Symphony of Southern New Jersey.

Cailliet is well known among wind musicians for his faithful arrangements of orchestral music for wind ensemble. In particular, his arrangements of Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral \(from Wagner's opera Lohengrin\) and Finlandia \(a symphonic poem by Jean Sibelius\) have become staples of the wind ensemble repertory.

Lucien Cailliet served as Associate Conductor of The Allentown Band \(Pennsylvania\) from 1934 until 1969. During that period, he conducted many of his arrangements on Allentown Band Concerts. In 1938, he dedicated his "Variations on the Theme Pop! Goes the Weasel" to The Allentown Band, an arrangement that continues to be a favorite or both bands and orchestras to this day. The renowned composer and arranger studied at several French music conservatories before graduating from the Dijon Conservatory at age twenty-two. He also received a degree from the National Conservatory in Paris. He was a bandmaster in the French Army and, in 1915, he toured the United States with the French Army Band. In 1919, he joined the Philadelphia Orchestra as a clarinetist, saxophonist, and arranger, where he worked closely with Leopold Stokowski. In 1923, at age thirty-two, Cailliet became an American citizen and continued to play with the Philadelphia Orchestra while attending graduate school at the Philadelphia Musical Academy. After receiving his Doctor of Music Degree in 1937, he moved to California to teach at the University of Southern California. After teaching there for seven years, he decided to devote his time to guest conducting and composing film scores.

In 1933, Cailliet performed Reynaldo Hahn's Sarabande et Theme on bass clarinet with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 1937, he made a new arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition. Cailliet also orchestrated three piano pieces of Sergei Rachmaninoff: the Serenade No. 5 from Morceaux de fantaisie Opus 3, the Prelude No. 5 in G minor from the 10 preludes of Opus 23, and the Prelude No. 5 in G major from the 13 preludes of Opus 32. He also made several arrangements for clarinet choir that have become staples of the repertoire.

Cailliet also enjoyed a prolific career creating music for films. He contributed to nearly fifty films as either composer or arranger. Among the best known of these films are She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, The Ten Commandments \(for which Elmer Bernstein wrote the score\), and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. His most famous orchestration is the virtuoso piece for piano and orchestra Midnight on the Cliffs by the pianist and composer Leonard Pennario, for the Andrew L. Stone's film Julie \(1956\).

In the 1950s, he lived in Kenosha, Wisconsin where he worked for the musical instrument producer G. Leblanc Company and conducted the Kenosha Symphony Orchestra\[1\]. He died at Woodland Hills.

Cailliet's name often appears as "Lucien Caillet" on printed music; this was merely a pervasive misspelling, according to the New Grove Dictionary of American Music.

\null\newpage \section{Alfred Reed}

REWRITE -- COPIED FROM WIKIPEDIA GET MY VERSION FROM TMTPIB

Alfred Reed \(January 25, 1921, New York – September 17, 2005, Miami, Florida\) was an American, neo-classical composer, with more than two hundred published works for concert band, orchestra, chorus, and chamber ensemble to his name. He also traveled extensively as a guest conductor, performing in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia.

Reed was born in New York and began his formal music training at the age of ten. During World War II, he served in the 529th Army Air Force Band. Following his military service, he attended the Juilliard School of Music, studying under Vittorio Giannini, after which he was staff composer and arranger first for NBC, then for ABC. In 1953, he became the conductor of the Baylor Symphony Orchestra at Baylor University, where he received his B.M. in 1955 and his M.M. in 1956. His master's thesis, Rhapsody for Viola and Orchestra, was awarded the Luria Prize in 1959. He was a member of the Beta Tau Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music.

From 1955 to 1966, he was the executive editor of Hansen Publications, a music publisher. He was professor of music at the University of Miami where he worked with composer Clifton Williams from 1966 until the latter's death in 1976. Williams' office was across the hall from Reed's office in the UM School of Music, and Reed was chairman of the department of Music Media and Industry and director of the Music Industry Program at the time of his retirement. He established the very first college-level music business curriculum at the University of Miami in 1966, which led other colleges and universities to follow suit. At the time of his death, he had composition commissions that would have taken him to the age of 115. Many of Reed's wind band compositions have been released as CD recordings by the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra.
