\textit{Transcribing orchestral music is a very touchy proposition, because it is my belief that if a transcription injures the original orchestration, it should not be done.\footnote{RJ Houser, `An Examination of Wind Band Transcriptions', PhD thesis, University of Texas, El Paso, 2008, p. }\\

The successful adaptation and performance of any music for a medium other than that for which it was originally composed requires that a fundamental question be first addressed: Is the goal to create a ``new'' work that is inspired by the original? Or is the goal to adapt the work to a different instrumentation such that it resembles the original as closely as possible? Or, is the wish to create some sort of combination of the two?
Usually, when a musical work is titled in the same way as its source, the term arrangement or transcription applies, yet these phrases seem to be utilized indiscriminately or even interchangeably. On a fundamental level, for the purposes of this study, appropriate characterizations are as follows:
1. Transcription: The primary goal is to adapt the work so that a different instrument (or instruments or voice / voices) can perform it. Literally, to ``translate.''47 The idea is to preserve as many aspects of the original as possible: aesthetic, colors, densities, form, keys, instrumentation/orchestration, etc. During the translation process, each of these areas may provide ``conflicts,'' and therein rests the challenge / art of creating a good transcription. However, the good transcriber seeks not to demonstrate his or her own compositional prowess, but rather to represent the intent of the original work and its composer.47. Merriam-Webster Inc., Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (Springfield: Merriam-Webster Inc, 1984), 1252.

2. Arrangement: The goal here, to varying degrees, is to create a new work based on the original. The scope of possibility is great, ranging from creative jazz charts / arrangements that perhaps match the original only in harmonic foundation and melodic inspiration, to projects that resemble their sources quite well, yet with intentional alterations in form, keys, or other fundamental elements.\footnote{RE Wyman, }

\begin{quotation}
	 Many transcriptions or arrangements feature significant compromises to composers' original artistic intents, to accommodate variations in performance settings, performer skill, ensemble size, etc. These arrangements may often be written in keys differing from their original versions (and thus ``easier'' to play), with liberal doublings, changes to form (``get right to the tune!''), and so on. This reality often makes it difficult for ensembles, performers, and conductors who wish to perform artistic or authentic renditions of orchestral works.\footnote{RE Wyman,}
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	Logistically, the process of selecting a particular work for transcription is not to be taken lightly, as not all works transcribe well. The odds of creating a successful wind transcription from an orchestral source are increased if, for example, the original features wind-heavy writing and doesn't emphasize string-specific techniques.\footnote{RE Wyman, }
\end{quotation}

\section{The quality of transcription}

Is a transcription as good as the original? If our aim is the communion with great minds, is that aim diluted or ruined by playing a composition not as the composer intended?
And that's for a direct accurate transcription such as Donald Hunsberger's transcription of the Shostakovich \textit{Festive Overture}.

\section{Emotion retained in the melody}
Scientific study

Whitwell example going up to minor sixth



\section{Change of key}
In his \textit{Neu-Er\"{o}ffnete Orchestre,} Mattheson discusses in more detail the natural emotions of specific scales, yielding some interesting conclusions.42 The key of F-sharp minor, for example, he finds,
\begin{quote}
is a key characterized by sadness, but a sadness more pensive and lovelorn than tragic and gloomy; it is a key that has about it a certain loneliness, an individuality, a misanthropy.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{Ancient views on what is music,} ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Publishing, Austin, 2013, p. 193.}
\end{quote}

\section{Simplified transcriptions}

The majority of the works included in this book are arrangements---they have been abridged, simplified and put into more suitable keys.

The next issue is what if the transcription is simplified for students. Does the piece still retain those qualities we chose the piece for in the first place? Science has shown that it is the melody that contains the emotion. Try playing a scale from the tonic to the sixth and back again, then do the same but play a flattened sixth and notice the emotional quality.

Are watered down versions ok?
Emotion is transferred by the melody ? find the scientific research
Therefore easier versions retain the emotion

Johann Mattheson REWRITE THIS once stated a very important truth which has recently been confirmed by clinical brain research. Basically, it is melody, not harmony, which communicates emotions to the listener. Mattheson writes that,
\begin{quote}
the nature and character of each key, namely whether it is happy, sad, lovely, devout, etc., are actually matters of the science of melody.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{Ancient views on what is music,} ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Publishing, Austin, 2013, p. 193.}
\end{quote}

Take for example SOMEONE'S arrangement \textit{Best of Beethoven}. Despite the title (which doesn't inspire confidence) the arrangement is very good---a medley of the opening of \textit{Symphony No. 5, Fur Elise} and \textit{Ode to Joy}. How can you deny students the chance to play the most famous four notes in Classical music history? As an added benefit, even in this simplified arrangement, conducting the opening of Beethoven No. 5 is still a great challenge.

\section{A note on tempo}
Tempi and difficulty---always perform things at the right tempo. This will increase the difficulty. The tempo cannot be disassociated from the melody/composition.

Many simplified arrangements are marked down at a slower tempo. For example, CITE EXAMPLE is notated at crotchet = 80 and therefore the piece is regarded as a Level 1; however, if the piece is performed at the tempo the composer intended, crotchet = 120, the arrangement retains the emotion the composer intended and is also much harder than a level 1.

\begin{quote}
Practice, care, and experience are required to attain the faculty for
maintaining steady tempo, which, in march and dance music, is absolutely
indispensible. But, while unmeaning vacillations of time in
other and more serious classes of music are reprehensible, it must be
fully understood and appreciated that musical aesthetics demand variations,
fluctuations, and modifications of tempo, as certainly as they
require undulations in height and depth, or sharp contrasts in pitch,
or changes of dynamic intensity for the expression of their beauties.
Sometimes changes, that is, modifications, are indicated by use of certain
qualifying terms, and those the director is bound to understand
and to develop their full significance in performance. At other times,
though not noted, there appears a quality in the music which appeals
to the director with temperament. It grips him, and willy-nilly, he
cannot resist the impulse to modify the tempo in order to create concord
of sentiment between speed, intensity, pitch, color, and melodic
flow. To disregard the potency of such complete union, to exaggerate
or undervalue anyone or more of those qualities amounts to perpetration of an offense against art.\footnote{clappe principles 1921}
\end{quote}
Clapp\'{e} continues,

\begin{quote}
The stiff, pedantic director who
rigidly adheres to metronomic accuracy is an offender of that type,
and, no matter how perfect other qualities may be developed, the impression
created by the performance under his control is unsatisfactory,
for grace of outline is marred and internal emotional impulse lies undeveloped.
On the other hand, the erratic director, who constantly
varies time in manner such as neither logic nor sentiment can justify,
is equally if not more guilty than the former whose renderings, if chilly
and stiff are, at least, chaste. Performance by the director of erratic
tendency savors of the influence of liquids freely but unwisely imbibed,
displaying that unsteadiness of tempo, which Schumann likened to the
``shambling gait of a drunken man.''\footnote{clappe principles 1921 p. 128}
\end{quote}

Clapp\'{e} makes an important point for all conductors:
\begin{quote}
Extremes must be avoided and performances of compositions by
band or orchestra should present concrete evidence to auditors that the
director has studied his score, is fully in accord with every phrase and
phase of its sentiment, and brings to its rendition fine intelligence, reasonable
interpretation, and warmth of an artistic temperament.\footnote{clappe principles 1921 p. 128}
