\section{The importance of repertoire}

Since the early 1900s conductors with a love for the wind band medium have been advocating for it to be considered as a serious vehicle for musical expression. To this end, conductors pursued the goal of establishing a standard wind band repertoire to replace the band's heavy use of orchestral transcriptions: a repertoire of compositions of high aesthetic worth that would one day be the equivalent of the standard orchestral repertoire. In 1921, Arthur Clapp\'{e},\index{Clapp\'{e}, Arthur} Director of the U.S. Army Music School, in the preface of his book, \textit{The Principles of Wind-Band Transcription}, articulated this desire. 


\begin{quote}
Compositions of the first rank have yet to be written for the wind band.\footnote{At the time of writing he may have been unaware of the compositions of Holst and Grainger.} For which reason, skillful musicians have been compelled to transcribe such works from among ``scores'' written for orchestra, organ, pianoforte, and voices.\\
\ldots\\
Herein, the effort is made to exhibit [the wind band's] more varied possibilities and furnish grounds for the claim, that, when seriously treated, the wind band is entitled to be regarded as a potential factor in the musical arena.\\
\dots\\
It is hoped that this book will assist in widening the horizon generally
believed to circumscribe the capabilities of wind instruments, and lead
to a higher conception than at present obtains of the wind-band as a
musical organism of great potency and high mission.\footnote{AA Clapp√©, \textit{The principles of wind-band transcription,} Carl Fischer, New York, 1921, pp. iii--iv.}

\end{quote}

During the century, as the need for band music increased, the market driven forces of the publishing industry and the increased popularity of school music competitions combined with a degrading of teachers' aesthetic judgement,  resulted in several generations of band students and conductors being raised on a very narrow stylistic band of music. Some conductors, especially those with careers outside of the band education sphere, became increasingly frustrated with the aesthetic standard of music being published and taught to school students.\\

Choosing music is the single most important thing a band director can do, and is the only thing a band director can do alone, made more important because of the substandard repertoire continually being published.\footnote{Fennell in Dvorak, Grechesky \& Ciepluch, p. 7.}
\end{quote}

Frank Battisti
\begin{quote}
The kind of music you play truly matters. While the music a band plays will help students to develop musicianship and technical skills, only the best music will allow students to fully appreciate band music for the true art form it is. In musical terms, we become what we experience.\footnote{F Battisti in TL Dvorak \& RL Floyd, \textit{Best music for beginning band: A selective repertoire guide to music and methods for beginning band,} ed. Bob Margolis, Manhattan Beach Music, Brooklyn, 2000, p. 11.}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
A great deal of the literature published and performed today by wind bands is devoid of any truly significant musical/expressive quality. When a conductor selects music of this quality, he/she radically diminishes the potential of the music experience for both players and listeners.\footnote{F Battisti, \textit{The winds of change,} Meredith Music, Galesville, MD, 2002, p. 243.}
\end{quote}


H. Robert Reynolds
\begin{quote}
Perhaps the most important task to face all conductors is the choice of the most appropriate literature \ldots\ The selection of quality music is further complicated by the deluge of superficial publications which constantly emerge each year to attract our attention.\footnote{HR Reynolds in TL Dvorak, CC Taggart \& P Schmalz, \textit{Best music for young band: a selective guide to the young band/young wind ensemble repertoire,} ed. Bob Margolis, Manhattan Beach Music, Brooklyn, 1986, p. 6.}
\end{quote}

Thomas L. Dvorak
\begin{quote}
It is extremely encouraging to all of us who value the musical growth of the young that a substantial repertoire of aesthetic character exists for them.\footnote{Dvorak, Taggart \& Schmalz, p. 7.}
\end{quote}

No-one would dispute these comments, and yet many band conductors, who must feel that this criticism is directed at someone else, continue to program poor quality repertoire.

It has been said before, ``the repertoire \textit{is} the curriculum''. Would it be preferable to rehearse below average music with an outstanding conductor, or to rehearse outstanding music with a below average conductor. I know which I would prefer. Conductors need to invest time and thought into repertoire selection. Without the right compositions in the musicians' folders, no amount of teaching skill or enthusiasm will help students develop a love of music.

\section{How did we get here?}
\begin{quote}
The problem is not how they play. It's what they play.\footnote{S Budiansky, \textit{The Washington Post,} `The Kids Play Great. But That Music \ldots', 30 January 2005, p. B03.}
\end{quote}

In 2005, journalist Stephen Budiansky wrote an article for \textit{The Washington Post} entitled ``The Kids Play Great. But That Music \ldots''. In this article he did not criticise the ability of music teachers to teach the skills of playing an instrument, or their classroom management skills or their enthusiasm, but he heavily criticised their choice of repertoire. Budiansky's article, and his followup with Timothy Foley for the \textit{Journal of the World Association for Symphonic Bands and Ensembles} was polarising. Budiansky admits that these articles ``caused more trouble than I ever imagined possible.''  Some identified with him and the problem immediately while many others believed his was an unfair attack on composers and the profession.

\begin{quotation}
Music composed specifically for school band is
formulaic, emotionally superficial, monotonously alike, dull, and didactic; that it fails to inspire
students; and that by being removed from any genuine living musical tradition, classical or
popular, it fails to provide students with a true musical education or the basis for further
independent exploration of music, either as a performer or a listener.\footnote{S Budiansky \& TW Foley, `The quality of repertoire in school music programs: literature review, analysis, and discussion', \textit{Journal of the World Association for Symphonic Bands and Ensembles,} vol. 12, 2005, pp. 17--39.}\\

\end{quotation}

One of the counterarguments to the Budiansky and Foley article was that ``the dearth of original music for wind band makes it important for bands to
support the composition and performance of new works written specifically for band and to
avoid relying on transcriptions of orchestral or other works.''\footnote{Budiansky \& Foley.} My response to this criticism is, ``Why?'' Why can't we rely on transcriptions of orchestral works to teach our students at the primary and high school level? 

\begin{quote}
All great musicians, as Arnold Jacobs observed, have no qualms whatsoever in playing
transcriptions as part of their essential musical education. Playing the music of the masters,
becoming familiar with the style and imagination of the greatest music of all genres, is how
fundamental musical sensibility is developed. Whatever may be the arguments for promoting
original band music as a performance goal for professional wind ensembles, such considerations
cannot be relevant to the education of students. The objective of repertoire selection at the
secondary school level---and even at the college level---should be to expose students to a rich
variety of the best music that will provide them a grounding for a lifetime of artistic appreciation
and enjoyment. In the case of band students, that inescapably means including a significant
quantity of high-quality, non-simplified transcriptions of great music originally written for other
orchestrations.\footnote{Budiansky \& Foley.}
\end{quote}

As stated in the quote above, it is not the core business of school music programs to promote original band music, to the detriment of students' overall study of music. It is more important to educate students in ``music'' rather than ``band music''. 

Pressures of an overloaded curriculum add to the problem. Teachers need to cover music theory, analysis, composition and performance including singing and solfege, as well as a variety of styles such as folk, world music, rock, and jazz. Students are graduating high school having heard possibly only a few of the great works of musical literature, and even then, they have not really experienced it.

Stephen Budiansky phrased it like this:

\begin{quote}
A bit of what is driving the dominance of all this pseudo-music are education-theory mandates that music education ``connect'' with other parts of the curriculum \ldots\ a bit comes, too, from pressures for parent-pleasing or competition-judge-pleasing pieces that are showy and give the illusion of being more advanced than they are.\footnote{Budiansky, `The Kids Play Great', p. B03. }
\end{quote}

The movement to create a standard high-quality band repertoire has not failed. For the better part of a century we have been promoting the wind band medium and encouraging composers to write for it and we now have, at the university and professional level, some absolute masterpieces.\footnote{Frederick Fennell and the Eastman Wind Ensemble must take a large part of the credit for many of the masterpieces we now have.} But at the school level (especially at levels 1--3), even though hundreds of new band compositions are published annually, we seem no closer to the goals of public audience engagement and a memorable repertoire? Could it be that the music we are playing at school is simply not memorable? Many works are so un-memorable that they have coined the term ``paper plate music'': play it once then throw it away!

The counter-argument to this is what percentage of all the music ever written for orchestra was so memorable that it is now considered ``standard repertoire''? Libraries around the world are filled with music for orchestra that will also never be played again. Is the band medium just too young? Or is the style of composition not engaging the emotions of players, audiences and conductors for it to be committed to our long-term memory as works of great artistic merit?

However, as mentioned above, the creation of a standard band repertoire is not the primary responsibility of school music programs. Providing students with an education that encompasses the greatest of compositions is. And although pleasing the audience should not be a goal of education either, performances that feature the most famous of orchestral classics will undoubtedly impress the audience more than the standard music education works that currently fill our concert programs. 

\section{Repertoire lists}
Selecting repertoire is a time-intensive activity for conductors. The conductor must analyse the goals of the music program, the requirements of the concerts (whether they are themed or ceremonial occasions), the technical level of the composition, and most importantly, its aesthetic quality, so it is no wonder that lists of recommended repertoire chosen by experts in the field, are so popular with time-poor conductors. 

\subsection{Competitions}
For those whose school year is dominated by competitions, some of this responsibility for repertoire selection is taken from the conductor, who must select his repertoire from the list provided by the competition organisers. Participating in a competition, besides being educationally unsound (music is an art, not a sport), will see the conductor selecting their repertoire from a narrow field and with different goals in mind than music education.

Budiansky and Foley, for their \textit{WASBE Journal} article, did extensive research into the repertoire lists of competitions to support their argument that many students were playing almost exclusively modern compositions, with very few examples of the great masterworks of the Classical and Romantic eras. Although their data is too extensive to reproduce here, it was summarised as follows:

\begin{quote}
Works of original wind band music by significant composers are performed substantially
less often (by a factor of about four) than these made-for-school works; works of significant
composers in transcription are performed even more rarely (by a factor of about ten). Along with
an increasing bias in favor of very recently composed works, a sharp reduction in the
performance of transcriptions has occurred over recent decades.\footnote{Budiansky \& Foley.}
\end{quote}

The sentence, ``works of significant composers in transcription are performed even more rarely (by a factor of about ten),'' causes me great concern, for it is these works that are the great works of music literature that all students should have the chance to experience.

\subsection{Books and Guides}
\begin{quote}

Any book of reviews from an authority on band literature, whether wholly agreed with or not, is of value in that it focuses attention on a few from the many thousands of available works. This book does just that, and in doing so frees the band director, teacher, or student, from the not always enjoyable chore of separating the wheat from the chaff.\footnote{B Margolis in Dvorak, Taggart \& Schmalz, p. 8.}---Bob Margolis on \textit{Best Music for Young Band}
\end{quote}

Band repertoire books are incredibly useful. As Bob Margolis put it in the quote above, the average school band director barely has the time to wade through the hundreds of new compositions that are released each year. However, most of the popular repertoire lists for band don't include many transcriptions. To add to the data presented by Budiansky and Foley, a  brief analysis of some of the most popular repertoire lists follows. These repertoire lists are still a valuable means of discovering compositions of high quality, but they must be used judiciously and with further thought to the overall picture of your students' education. Used exclusively to pick your repertoire you will find yourself conducting pieces that were all composed in the last twenty years!

The following repertoire lists will be analysed:

As you can see from the tables above, these resources that many of us have used and relied on over the years are skewed towards the upper levels and to contemporary music. The skew towards contemporary music is not surprising, if we remember the consistent push to create an original band repertoire throughout the 1900s, but I am surprised by the size of the skew.

We need to find more resources that represent the same historical periods equally for the lower technical levels.

My analysis of these books was not to disparage them in any way, but to show young conductors that they must not rely solely on these books (or other lists like them) to choose their repertoire, but to use them as resources in creating a balanced repertoire.

\begin{itemize}
\item 94\% of all compositions in TMTPIB were composed in the last 112 years (since 1900).

\item Of the 94\% of pieces composed since 1900, 60\% of these were composed since 1990, the last 27 years.

\item 56\% of all pieces, in the 10 volumes of TMTPIB, were composed in the last 27 years (since 1990).
\end{itemize}

\section{Sixty}
I've always regarded repertoire selection an important process. When I first started teaching as a young twenty-year-old my philosophy was to program an original band work, a transcription, a march, and an Australian composition each term. But this theory left out the most important criteria of all---the aesthetic quality. I became dissatisfied with this dogmatic approach and started using many of the reference texts listed in the previous section. I thought there were far better qualified people than me who new more about repertoire, so I poured over the repertoire lists and chose compositions from them (even though some of the inclusions puzzled me).

Later in my career, after gaining more experience and further study, I changed tack again. I counted how many pieces of music one of my students would get to play in their time at high school. To put this in context, students in Australian schools perform in band as a co-curricular activity, usually for only 60--90 minutes each week, either before or after school. With such a limited time to study  performance students generally cover about three pieces each term. Adding these up, 3 pieces a term, 4 terms a year, for 5 years (Years 8 to 12), comes to a total of 60 pieces. \textit{Sixty pieces of music is the sum total of a student's music performing experience at an average high school.}

\begin{quote}
For most secondary school music students, the
music they play in ensembles is their fundamental introduction to music. Most band students do
not go on to be professional musicians; many will never even pick up their instruments again
after high school. The repertoire they encounter in high school band thus is a large part of the
only formal musical education they will ever receive in their lifetime: It is what they will carry
with them in subsequent years. If they have had a chance to encounter and play great music~\ldots\ , they will have instilled in them a love of music that will inspire them to be listeners and appreciators of music
throughout their lives.\footnote{Budiansky \& Foley.}
\end{quote}

This calculation made me reconsider every piece of music I put in front of the students. I also reflected on my own time at high school. As a student in the school band I played not one piece from the Classical period (or earlier) and from the Romantic period only one or two selections in five years (probably Wagner's \textit{Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral}). And I went to a good school with an award-winning music program and an enthusiastic, talented conductor. It was then that I started to think more about transcriptions---if a student gets through their high school life and hasn't played Mozart, Bach or Beethoven, regardless of what instrumentation Mozart, Bach or Beethoven originally wrote for, then surely this is a sub-standard excuse for music education. Are we punishing students for playing in band instead of orchestra? Nowadays, if I have to choose between a modern educationally composed work that is easy to rehearse and will sound great, or a transcription of one of the masters that is harder and more time consuming to rehearse, and inevitably does not sound as polished as the former, I will take the masterpiece every time.

I challenge those of you interested in this topic to make yourselves a list. Write down what you consider to be the ten most important, moving, indispensable pieces of music ever written, regardless of what medium they were originally composed for, be it band, orchestra, piano, choir, or chamber ensemble. Wouldn't this list be an obvious place to start when teaching our students? If these ten pieces are the most important to you, why restrict your students to recently composed band music that is not on your list?

\section{Coda}

In my experience, a paradigm shift of the purpose of primary and high school music teaching has led me to program a higher percentage of transcriptions from the classical western canon. I believe I have happier audiences (including parents and school admin personnel), more engaged students who have now realised they are playing ``real'' music, well-rounded musicians with increased skill and students who have a deeper grasp of the major works in the classical western canon.


I have my own list of pieces and they were originally composed for a variety of mediums. It's now a lot longer than sixty, but every one of these pieces deserves to be there and any band composition has to \textit{earn} a place on my list.

The following eloquent passage by David Whitwell is, to me, a perfect summation of this topic: 

\begin{quotation}
Music will always represent the culture from which it springs. The general musical practice of a people can never rise above the culture of the people; primitive people will always be represented by primitive music. It is here that some American music educators make the unbelievable error of treating the art music of Western Europe as a mere category among the music of the world's people. The implication they suggest is that all music is equal, since it is all music. But this is not true. An igloo is not the Chartres Cathedral and they differ not so much in architectural description as they do in the levels of culture they represent.

The fact is that the cultural heritage of Western Europe is not ``the culture of a certain time and place,'' as educators label it. It is rather the accumulation of the experience of Western man himself. The nineteenth-century masterpieces of music of Western Europe are not just representatives of nineteenth-century Western Europe, they are the highest chapter of development in something which began four thousand years earlier with equal roots in Greece, Rome, Egypt and the Near East. It is the art music of all Western men. To call nineteenth-century German music ``German,'' is to betray a poor understanding of Western Civilization. For teachers to not want to pass on the highest achievements of man to the next generation, is a dereliction of duty.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{Aesthetics of music in ancient civilizations,} ed. Craig Dabelstein, 2nd edn, Whitwell Publishing, Austin, 2011, p. 8.}
