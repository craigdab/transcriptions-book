\section{Bands played before Strings} Historically the band played transcriptions to the public BEFORE the orchestral version was heard. QUOTE WHITWELL

\begin{quotation} It is also important to remember that during the beginning years of the nineteenth century, 1\) the concept of `public concerts' in the modern sense was something still relatively new, and 2) the symphony orchestras as we think of them today did not yet exist (most orchestras were opera orchestras; very few of today's famous orchestras existed as concert organizations before 1850). Yet there \textit{were} at this time large military bands who were performing disciplined and artistic concerts before the public. These performances were sufficiently successful that, as the reader will discover below, composers and publishers began asking the military bands to`prepare' the public, through their performances, for the original orchestral versions of their music.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The nineteenth-century wind band and wind ensemble,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2012, p. 99.} \end{quotation}

More on the topic:

\begin{quotation} One factor which helped create the success military bands had with the public was their technical excellence. In the years before the impact of the conservatories was widely felt, and before the modern, well-disciplined symphony orchestras appeared, the military band may often have exceeded the local orchestra in many technical performance qualities. The reason for this, of course, was because the military bands enjoyed a residual military discipline as the foundation for their music making. The aesthetic significance of this was recognized by the famous nineteenth-century critic, Eduard Hanslick. \begin{quotation} In this form, the regimental band emerges out of its purely military role and reaches higher artistic purposes. These are the so-called `Garden concerts' by which the military bands o er the court a favorite recreation and often give small cities a full artistic musical experience. The many and strenuous rehearsals for this concert [a concert of the music of Berlioz, given in Prague] allow us to see the value of military subordination for artistic reasons; no conductor of any civic orchestra would have been able to manage this performance at that time. It may go against some idealistic theories that art could be encouraged through something so very different from personal freedom as subordination, however it is so. Every art has in its technique one facet which can only be developed through constant work, and this technical side is even more important in the work of many together than by the individual virtuoso. The conductor's baton and the corporal's stick both have the purpose of bringing many heads together under one hat \ldots\ where the artistic subordination joins with the military subordination,`a good sound results.' In the Garden concerts or other non-military performances the military bands are in a better position than other mediums to pursue purely artistic goals. The position of the conductor appears here more independent, the selection of the repertoire more free, and the means more complete. In any case, from these favorable conditions springs a stronger obligation to art.\footnote{E Brixel, \textit{Das ist Österreichs Militär Musik,} p. 107.} \end{quotation} \end{quotation}

\begin{quotation} The musical demands of the Spohr and the Maschek works, together with the language of the early Journal advertise- ments and the comments of Hanslick quoted above, suggest to me that in the German-speaking countries one would have definitely found examples of military bands before 1820 who were outstanding in quality and aesthetically oriented. This also seems implied in an 1816 eyewitness account by the French Novelist, Henri Beyle \(Pseud., Stendhal\), who heard what was apparently a massed band concert in Milan.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The nineteenth-century wind band and wind ensemble,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2012, p. 103.} \begin{quotation} Yesterday at 1:00 in the Giardini was a very excellent instrumental con- cert. Every German regiment has a band with 80 musicians. A hundred pretty women were eve-dropping on this distinguished music. Played were the most beautiful works of Mozart and the young Rossini.\footnote{Quoted in Veit, \textit{Die Blasmusik,} 61.} \end{quotation} \end{quotation}

\begin{quotation} These military bands, as bands still do, continued through- out the century to perform transcriptions of major orchestral works. These performances seem rarely to have been debated with regard to the principle of transcriptions, but rather seem to have been accepted on the same level as orchestral performances. The key to the latter was found in the high quality of performance, especially by the Prussian bands, as one can see in an 1858 review of a concert conducted by Piefke, by the very distinguished musician and critic, Hans von Bülow.

We had the satisfaction on numerous occasions to attend the accomplished performance of his band and we were always surprised by the technical perfection, the painstaking nuance of every detail, the majestic power of the mass impression and finally the fresh full vibrating spirit of the noble performances. The A Major Symphony by Beethoven, Wagner's Overture to Tannh\"{a}user, the transcription of the first Finale, Pilgrim's Chorus, Prayer, and Romance from Act iii of Lohengrin which we heard were satisfying, as one would not have thought in this sphere and brought to the conducting and the entire band the highest honor. The choice of the Seventh Symphony of Beethoven appeared to us genuinely successful; this apotheosis permitted a unity of character with that which had been played earlier, for example the transcription of Beethoven's C Minor Symphony by Wieprecht---a work by which he had obtained his great reputation. The Scherzo and Trio, as well as the last movement, were in this transcription of such an overpowering and compelling e ect that it was possible for one at the moment to completely forget the original instrumentation.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The nineteenth-century wind band and wind ensemble,} 2nd edn, ed.

As an example: France 1711 concert bands \(68 just in Paris!\) and another 4000+ brass bands \(more than 100,000 participants!\) Belgium 478 concert bands, 1216 brass bands

By the end of the 1800s there were lots of bands.

\begin{quotation} By World War I, no fewer than 541 separate bands were authorised for the various branches of the Prussian military \(including naval bands\) and on a summer evening in Berlin you could hear any of twenty to thirty different military band concerts!\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The nineteenth-century wind band and wind ensemble,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2012, p. 36.}

\end{quotation}

And in Berlin,

\begin{quotation} The choice of band concerts in Berlin was such that by the 1830s one could hear them at almost any hour of the day, beginning at 5 o’clock in the morning!\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The nineteenth-century wind band and wind ensemble,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2012, p. 109.} \end{quotation}

\section{Legal Deposit} Thanks to legal deposit we have a very clear picture of what bands played through the publishers depositing their scores in the national libraries.

\begin{quotation} If one can judge by the extant repertoire of the French military bands during the second half of the nineteenth century, they too must have had very active concert schedules. The extant published repertoire alone includes many hundreds of original symphonies, overtures, fantasies, solo and ensemble works with band accompaniment, not to mention thousands of orchestral transcriptions.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The nineteenth-century wind band and wind ensemble,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2012, p. 112.} \end{quotation}

The 1867 World Band Competition in Paris ten bands from nine countries Works performed included: \begin{itemize}

```text
\item Oberon by Weber
```

\item Finale to Loreley by Mendelssohn \item Fantaisie on Spanish melodies composed by Gevaert \item Fantaisie on themes from Meyerbeer's Propheten, arranged for the occasion by Wieprecht. \item Overture to William Tell \item Fantaisie on themes from William Tell \item `Introduction and Bridal Chorus' from Lohengrin \item Fantaisie in themes from Gounod's Faust \item`Bridal Chorus' from Lohengrin \item Overture to Glinka's Life of the Tsar \item Fantaisie on the \`Carnival of Venice' \end{itemize}

\begin{quotation} Several important composers sought out opportunities to have their works arranged for military bands in the hope that the subsequent performances would help to build an audience for the original ver- sions of their music! This point is stressed by Wilhelm Stephan, who, as Inspector of Music for the German Armed Forces, was later a successor to Wieprecht. \begin{quotation} We must realize, however, that in the period before the radio or recordings, it was largely through military music that the work of the great composers, somewhat transformed to be sure, became known to the public through the many military concerts held throughout the country. \end{quotation} Thus Liszt, Meyerbeer, and Spontini all asked Wieprecht to transcribe their music for this purpose.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The nineteenth-century wind band and wind ensemble,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2012, p. 122.}
