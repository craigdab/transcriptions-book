\textit{We are what we consume! If one wants to become an artist conductor / teacher---one must consume great Art.\footnote{Battisti, p. 242.}\ --- Frank Battisti\ }

Era before educational music\

\begin{quote} It bears emphasizing that in no other realm of the musical world is a comparable prejudice against transcriptions found: even symphony orchestras, which certainly have no shortage of original works to draw upon, embrace transcriptions without hesitation when artistic merit warrants it. Transcriptions for orchestra of many of Bach's fugues \(originally written for keyboard\), of Brahms's \textit{Hungarian Dances} and Dvorak's \textit{Slavonic Dances} \(originally for piano four hands\), and of Mussorgsky's \textit{Pictures at an Exhibition} and Debussy's \textit{Clair de Lune} \(originally for piano\) are standard parts of the orchestral repertoire; indeed, many of these orchestral versions are today far better known their originals.\footnote{Budiansky \& Foley.} \end{quote}

\section{Historically relevant} connections with other areas of curriculum

Including more transcriptions in your program does not mean compromising the curricular goals. Richard Miles even advocates their use for improving the aims of the curriculum.

\begin{quote} Making connections to other disciplines and cultures through a historical perspective can lead to deeper valuing, understanding, and fulfillment in music making. Therefore by emphasizing these elements a greater musical literacy, accountability, and alignment with current educational direction can be achieved.\footnote{RB Miles \(ed\), \textit{Teaching music through performance in band,} vol. 2, GIA Publications, Chicago, 1998, p. XX.} \end{quote}

And more than twenty years ago, Allen Britton made this statement:

\begin{quote} Should not our music curriculum consist, first of all, of the world's most beautiful music? Should a child be able to sing in a high school choir or play in a high school band or orchestra for several years and still not have come to know at least a fair sample of the best there is in our musical heritage? \ldots To construct curriculums with music of lasting beauty would by no means exclude the use of new music or even of the teaching pieces now so widely available. It would, however, ensure that music of the greatest worth would be presented to our students in larger quantities than is now the case, and that they would know some of it when they get out of school.\footnote{AP Britton, \`American music education: Is it better than we think? A discussion of the roles of performance and repertory, together with brief mention of certain other problems', in R Colwell \(ed\), \textit{Basic concepts in music education,} vol. 2, University Press of Colorado, Niwot, 1991, pp. 175--188.} \end{quote}

\section{Communion with great minds} playing Beethoven is as similar as reading Shakespeare

\section{Communication of feelings} one of the biggest complaints of modern school band music is it is either devoid of feelings or they are superficial.

This music was composed before

Communication of feelings was a priority over educational aims\ More varied levels of expression\

Bach chorales have been a staple of the band warmup for decades \(see Thurston, \textit{Bach and Before for Band} etc\). They are used to teach tone, balance of the melodic line, bringing out interior moving parts, intonation, etc. However, a contemporary of Bach's made this observation regarding ideas of Bach on the emotions: \begin{quote} As concerns the playing of chorales, I was instructed by my teacher Kapellmeister Bach, who is still living, not to play the songs merely offhand but according to the emotions of the words.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{Ancient views on what is music,} ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Publishing, Austin, 2013, p. 196.} \end{quote} Never in my amateur or professional career have I heard conductors use Bach chorales as \`\`emotional warmups'', to work on bringing out feelings of melancholy, sadness, joy, etc.

Band repertoire is filled with programmatic music \(and very little absolute music\) and many mistake programmatic music for conveying feelings of emotion. Charles Avison once made this point, that what we call \`\`text-painting,'' \(think of pieces based on trains, rain, rivers etc. and a plethora of other programmatic music\) is not an example of music communicating feeling. This is more like metaphor and detracts from the genuine expression of emotions which is the nature of music.REWRITE OR CITE WHITWELL \begin{quote} What then is the composer, who would aim at true musical expression, to perform? I answer, he is to blend such a happy mixture of melody and harmony, as will affect us most strongly with the passions or affections which the poet intends to raise: and that, on this account, he is not principally to dwell on particular words in the way of imitation, but to comprehend the poet's general drift or intention? If he attempts to raise the passions by imitation, it must be such a temperate and chastised imitation, as rather brings the object before the hearer, than such a one as induces him to form a comparison between the object and the sound. For, in this last case, \[the listener's\] attention will be turned entirely on the composer's art, which must effectually check the passion. The power of music is, in this respect, parallel to the power of eloquence: if it works at all, it must work in a secret and unsuspected manner.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{Ancient views on what is music,} ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Publishing, Austin, 2013, p. 255.} \end{quote}

\section{The audience is oblivious to the original} Students, parents, school admin are oblivious to the original and wouldn't care anyway. In the case of popular classics, the audience finds them more enjoyable than standard band music, because they know the tunes.

\section{More benefits}

A more balanced education. ALL STUDENTS should have the experience of playing Mozart and Beethoven ?

Helpful for those students pursuing music as a career. Many wind and brass students at university level have had no experience playing classical or romantic music. Some experience of Renaissance and Baroque maybe.

\subsection{Technical problems}

The most obvious problem though are the technical demands of the music. Beginner band students cannot play the masterpieces of music in their original form. However, enough high quality transcriptions and arrangements now exist that students of all technical abilities have the opportunity to experience these masterpieces first hand. The repertoire lists in part two of this book will point conductors to suitable arrangements at each level of technical development. This problem is summarised in the following quote.

\begin{quotation} I do understand the pedagogic purpose behind this stuff. Beethoven didn't have to come up with music scored for middle school bands made up of 57 alto saxophones, 40 trumpets, 15 percussionists and one oboe. Fair enough.

But music education is supposed to be about more than just learning to make your fingers move the right way. It's also supposed to be about having the chance to experience firsthand the truly great music of all genres---the great music that, after all, is the whole point of learning to play or sing.\footnote{Budiansky, 30 January 2005} \end{quotation}

\subsection{Fear of the audience reaction}

David Whitwell addresses this concern in his \textit{Art of Musical Conducting:}

\begin{quotation} The most commonly heard answer, when a conductor is asked about the absence of quality music in his repertoire, is \`my audience will not let me play that kind of music.' This is a completely unfounded allegation, one which attempts to conceal the taste of the conductor and has nothing to do with the taste of the audience \ldots We must set this superstition aside once and for all. The fact is that the audience \ldots does not come to a concert \textit{expecting} any particular music. They \textit{do} come to a concert expecting a \textit{concert} \ldots We believe it is correct to say that all an audience really expects, or hopes for, in a concert is that it be good.\footnote{D Whitwell, \textit{The art of musical conducting,} 2nd edn, ed. Craig Dabelstein, Whitwell Books, Austin, 2011, p. 259.} \end{quotation}

New quote by Joseph Wagner:

\begin{quotation} There is a place for artistic transcriptions of keyboard music \(harpsichord, piano, or organ\) in the band repertory. Music in this form is not likely to invite comparisons with settings involving some overlapping of instrumentation \ldots\

```text
Band transcriptions of orchestral music often arouse strong prejudices and comparisons among those who are familiar with the orchestra but who are not equally well informed about the band. These reactions, often caused by rescored band parts which differ from their orchestral counterparts, are usually unavoidable because of inherently different problems of resonance and balance in the two ensembles. Band scoring and orchestration are developed from dissimilar basic choirs; this necessarily affects scoring plans and methods.\footnote{J. Wagner, \textit{Scoring for Band,} McGraw-Hill, New York, 1960, p. 9.}
